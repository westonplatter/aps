# Rust Core Principles

## Clarity Beats Cleverness
Readable, explicit code is preferred over compact or "smart" code.
- Use descriptive names over short ones
- Prefer match over deeply nested if chains
- Avoid overly generic abstractions unless reuse is proven
- Optimize for the next human (or agent) reading this code.

## Small, Testable Units
- Prefer small functions with narrow responsibility.
- One function = one job
- Pure functions when possible
- Add unit tests for behavior, not implementation
- If it's hard to test, it's probably doing too much.

## Case-Insensitive File Name Checks
All file name comparisons (e.g. detecting SKILL.md, README.md, or any
well-known file) must be case-insensitive. Use `eq_ignore_ascii_case`
in Rust rather than exact string equality. This ensures consistent
behavior across case-sensitive and case-insensitive file systems.
